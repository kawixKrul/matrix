# Matrix

**Matrix** is a project written in Haskell, aiming to implement matrix algorithms and related operations. This project includes various matrix functions that can be used for mathematical computations.

## Features
- Basic matrix operations
- Advanced algorithm implementations (customize based on your features)

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- [GHC](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/) (Glasgow Haskell Compiler)
- [Cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/) for building Haskell projects

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kawixKrul/matrix.git
   cd matrix

2. Build the project using Cabal:
cabal build
3. Run the project using Cabal:
cabal run
4. Alternatively, if there are test files, you can run:
cabal test
